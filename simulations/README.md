# Sudoku Number Calculation for 3-Regular Graphs

## Project Description
This project attempts to compute the **Sudoku number** (also known as the defining number) of random 3-regular graphs. Specifically, it generates graphs that are Hamiltonian cycles with a perfect matching and applies a decycling algorithm to it.
The set of nodes not in the decycling set is assumed to be a good candidate for a sudoku set. We try to find a coloring of those nodes that infer a maximum number of nodes. This will not always give the sudoku set but usually can be extended to one by adding a single additional node to it.

The sudoku number refers to the minimum number of nodes of a graph that need to be colored such that there is a unique extension to a $k$-coloring of the whole graph, where $k$ is the graph's chromatic number. Such a minimal set of nodes is called sudoku set (or defining set).

## Features
1. **Random 3-Regular Graph Generation**:
   - Generates 3-regular graphs with a Hamiltonian cycle and a perfect matching.
   - Asymptotically a random 3-regular graph is a Hamilton cycle and a perfect matching
